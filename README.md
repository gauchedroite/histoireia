# teller
A **game engine**, a **live editor** and a **debugging environment** (IDE) for browser based text adventure games.

## Related projects
The documentation for the engine is in the [wiki](https://github.com/gauchedroite/teller/wiki).

Each games has its own project to store their assets. For example, all assets for *Billy* are in [tellergame-billy](https://github.com/gauchedroite/tellergame-billy).

The games can be played here in [teller](https://gauchedroite.github.io/teller). They're just uninteresting tests though.

## Notes
Do not forget to `npm run dev` while developing, to compile *.ts to *.js.

Do not forget to `npm run live` before updating the repository. This will take everything under /public and move it to /live - the folder that actually gets used for playing the game on GitHub.
